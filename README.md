# Drowsiness Detection
 
For my project, I developed a driver drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and dlib. It tracks eye movements in real time through video processing, analyzing the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect signs of drowsiness. When the EAR falls below a certain threshold, indicating fatigue, the system triggers an alert. This practical solution aims to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving. It showcases the power of machine learning and image processing in real-world applications.
